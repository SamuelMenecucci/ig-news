//if I want to use SSG (Static Site Generation), the only thing I need to change is: change the name of the const to getStaticProps and the type to the same.
//When I use Static Site Generation, instead next server make a call every time that a user use the application, he will generate a static html file whit all informations that was returned from server on the first call. so, every user will see this static html file. the static html file will update using the time (in seconds) of the revalidate property, that i need to pass when I use the getStaticProps
